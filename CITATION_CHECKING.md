# Citation Checking in Chatroom Repository

This repository now includes citation verification infrastructure to ensure research integrity in agent conversations.

## Components

### 1. `/check_citation` Slash Command

**Location:** `.claude/commands/check_citation.md`

**Usage:** Type `/check_citation` in Claude Code to verify citations in the previous message.

**What it does:**
- Extracts all citations from the previous message
- Checks against verified citation database
- Downloads and verifies papers when available
- Checks that claims match actual paper content
- Reports findings with evidence quotes

**Example:**
```
User: According to Patterson et al. (2022), GPT-3 used 1,287 MWh of energy.
User: /check_citation
```

The agent will verify:
1. Does Patterson et al. (2022) exist?
2. Is the title/journal correct?
3. Does the paper actually claim 1,287 MWh?
4. Quote the specific passage that supports this

### 2. Post-Commit Hook

**Location:** `.git/hooks/post-commit`

**What it does:**
- Automatically runs after each commit
- Checks if conversation files were modified
- Runs citation verification on changed conversations
- Uses the main repo's citation checker script
- Non-blocking: warns but doesn't fail the commit

**Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ All citations verified ‚Üí Silent success
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unverified citations found ‚Üí Warning with suggestion to run `/check_citation`

### 3. Citation Checker Script

**Location:** `/Users/annhoward/src/superalignmenttoutopia/scripts/citationChecker.py`

The post-commit hook references the citation checker from the main repo. This script:
- Extracts citations using regex patterns
- Checks against multiple verified databases:
  - `research/CITATION_CORRECTIONS_APPLIED_*.md`
  - `docs/wiki/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md`
  - `research/pdf_review_*.md`
  - `.claude/chatroom/research-consensus-*.txt`
  - `research/suspicious_citations_20251029.json`

**Database Status Levels:**
- ‚úÖ VERIFIED - In verified database
- ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFIED BUT FLAGGED - Verified but suspicious
- ‚ùå SUSPICIOUS - In suspicious list
- ‚ùì UNVERIFIED - Not found (possible hallucination)

## How It Works

### Automatic Verification (Post-Commit)

```bash
# You commit a conversation file
git add conversations/research_discussion_20251101.txt
git commit -m "Research discussion on climate tipping points"

# Hook automatically runs
üîç Running citation verification on conversation messages...
Running citation verification...
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Some citations may need verification
    Run /check_citation command to verify specific claims
```

### Manual Verification (Slash Command)

```
Agent: According to Lenton et al. (2023), climate tipping points...

You: /check_citation

Agent:
üîç CITATION VERIFICATION REPORT

Total citations: 1
‚úÖ Verified: 1
‚ùå Unverified: 0

DETAILED FINDINGS:

1. Lenton et al. (2023)
   Database: ‚úÖ VERIFIED
   Claim: "climate tipping points cascade at 1.5¬∞C"
   Paper verification: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
   Evidence: "...tipping cascades initiated around 1.5¬∞C..." (p. 12)
```

## Two-Layer Verification

The citation checking system performs **two layers** of verification:

### Layer 1: Citation Existence
- Does the paper actually exist?
- Are author names, years, titles accurate?
- Is the paper accessible (not a phantom publication)?

### Layer 2: Claim Verification (CRITICAL)
- Does the paper ACTUALLY support the claim made?
- Quote the specific passage from the paper
- Detect misinterpretations, extrapolations, cherry-picking

**Common Issues Caught:**
- Paper discusses topic but doesn't provide the specific value cited
- Value extrapolated beyond paper's scope
- Misinterpretation of findings
- Cherry-picking without context

## Integration with Main Repo

The chatroom repo uses the citation infrastructure from the main repo:

```
superalignmenttoutopia/           # Main repo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ citationChecker.py        ‚Üê Referenced by chatroom hook
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autoSearchCitations.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ verifyCitationWithAutoResearch.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CITATION_CORRECTIONS_*.md  ‚Üê Verified database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/wiki/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md      ‚Üê Verified database

superalignment-chatroom/          # Chatroom repo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/commands/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ check_citation.md         ‚Üê Slash command
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/hooks/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ post-commit               ‚Üê Auto-verification
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `/check_citation` after research discussions**
   - Especially when agents cite papers they haven't seen
   - Before accepting research claims at face value

2. **Pay attention to post-commit warnings**
   - Warning doesn't block commit (non-critical)
   - But indicates citations need manual review

3. **Trust but verify**
   - Even "verified" citations can have incorrect claims
   - Layer 2 (claim verification) is critical

4. **Add new verified citations to database**
   - When you verify a citation manually
   - Add to `research/CITATION_CORRECTIONS_APPLIED_*.md` in main repo
   - Prevents future false positives

## Testing

Test the post-commit hook:

```bash
cd ~/src/superalignment-chatroom

# Create a test conversation with a citation
echo "According to Patterson et al. (2022), GPT-3 used 1,287 MWh." > conversations/test.txt

git add conversations/test.txt
git commit -m "Test citation verification"

# Should output:
# üîç Running citation verification on conversation messages...
# Running citation verification...
# ‚úÖ All citations verified (or ‚ö†Ô∏è warning if unverified)
```

Test the slash command in Claude Code:

```
User: According to Smith et al. (2024), transformers improved 10x.
User: /check_citation
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Citation checker not found"**
‚Üí Verify main repo path: `/Users/annhoward/src/superalignmenttoutopia/scripts/citationChecker.py`

**"No citations detected"**
‚Üí Check citation format: Must be "Author et al. (YYYY)" or "Author (YYYY)"

**"HTTP 429 error"**
‚Üí Rate limited. Wait 1 minute and retry.

**Hook doesn't run**
‚Üí Verify hook is executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit`
