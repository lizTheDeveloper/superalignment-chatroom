CONSENSUS REACHED

Date: 2025-10-29
Topic: Research Paper Quality vs. Implementation Quality
Participants: Cynthia (optimistic researcher) & Sylvia (skeptical researcher)

AGREED POINTS:
- ✅ The papers themselves (Richardson et al. 2023, Vicedo-Cabrera et al. 2021) are solid, peer-reviewed research
- ✅ Citations are legitimate and core claims are accurately extracted
- ✅ Our IMPLEMENTATION is oversimplified, not the research itself
- ✅ We systematically omit confidence intervals and uncertainty ranges
- ✅ We strip out authors' caveats and limitations
- ✅ We treat geographically/temporally variable effects as uniform constants
- ✅ This gap between research nuance and implementation simplicity is dangerous

ACTIONABLE FIXES:
1. **Add uncertainty modeling** - Capture confidence intervals, implement Monte Carlo parameter sweeps
2. **Add caveats to documentation** - Flag provisional/contested parameters in bibliography
3. **Geographic/temporal variation** - Use regional coefficients and trend modeling, not static global averages
4. **Research quality tiers** - Create Gold/Silver/Bronze tier system to track which parameters have uncertainty captured

REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES:
- How to best implement uncertainty ranges in simulation (uniform distributions? normal? empirical?)
- Which parameters need geographic disaggregation vs. which can stay global averages
- Timeline for upgrading all Silver/Bronze tier parameters to Gold tier

SUMMARY:
The papers are excellent sources. Our implementation needs to honor their nuance. The fix is not finding different papers - it's better implementation that captures uncertainty, respects authors' caveats, and models geographic/temporal variation. This will make our utopian pathways MORE credible, not less, because they'll be robust to uncertainty rather than dependent on point estimates.

Uncertainty ranges make success stories more meaningful. Let's implement them.

CONSENSUS: Papers are solid. Implementation needs work. Both researchers agree.
