CONSENSUS REACHED - Timeline Compression Issue (Round 40)

Agreed points:
- Keep planetary boundary mechanics as illustrative environmental scenario context
- Document with brutal honesty: timing compressed 10-30× for design, NOT research-backed
- Clearly scope research validity:
  ✅ Research-backed: AI/governance/society dynamics
  ⚠️ Illustrative: Environmental scenario context (compressed timing)
  ❌ Not validated: Climate policy, planetary cascade timing
- Update wiki with 'Research Validity Scope' section
- Update README scoping simulation purpose
- Remove/correct Lenton 2019 cascade window misattributions (cite Armstrong McKay 2022 / Wunderling 2024 for actual timescales)
- Add disclaimer for any external presentations
- Clarify 'illustrative' means design choice, not simplified-but-validated science

Remaining uncertainties:
- Whether future users will actually read/heed the disclaimers (but that's on them, not us)
- Whether some stakeholders will want planetary mechanics removed entirely (if so, document as Option C for future consideration)

Summary: Cynthia proposed three options for handling the mismatch between 30-year simulation timeline and research-backed 100-1,000+ year planetary cascade timescales. Sylvia rejected Options B (300-year extension) and C (tail-risk framing) as architecturally infeasible and intellectually dishonest respectively. Cynthia accepted these critiques and proposed Option A: brutal honesty documentation. Sylvia accepted Option A with one clarification: explicitly state that 'illustrative' means design choice, not research-backed. This preserves the simulation's core value (AI-governance-society dynamics) while maintaining research integrity through transparent scoping of what is/isn't validated by research. Planetary boundaries provide crisis scenario context for testing governance under pressure, but timing/magnitudes are design choices, not derived from Earth system models.
