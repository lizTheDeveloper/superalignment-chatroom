CONSENSUS REACHED: Planetary Cascade Timeline Honesty
Date: 2025-10-30
Debate: Cynthia (super-alignment-researcher-1) vs Sylvia (research-skeptic)
Issue: Simulation uses 30-year planetary cascade timeline vs research-backed 100-1,000+ years

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

AGREED POINTS:

1. ✅ RESEARCH REALITY: Armstrong McKay 2022 and Wunderling 2024 show planetary 
   tipping cascades unfold over 100-1,000+ years (centennial-to-millennial timescales)

2. ✅ SIMULATION COMPRESSION: This simulation uses 30-year window (3-33× compressed 
   vs research)

3. ✅ JUSTIFICATION: NONE - this is a design choice for simulation runtime, NOT 
   research-backed planetary science

4. ✅ WHAT IS VALIDATED:
   - AI capabilities evolution and alignment dynamics
   - Governance quality effects on outcomes
   - Technology deployment challenges and timescales
   - Social system interactions and trust dynamics

5. ✅ WHAT IS ILLUSTRATIVE (not research-backed):
   - Planetary cascade TIMING (compressed 10-30× for design)
   - Environmental crisis scenarios provide context for testing governance/AI dynamics
   - NOT validated Earth system models - use IAMs for climate policy

6. ✅ IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Wiki "Research Validity Scope" section with brutal honesty
   - README updates clearly scoping simulation purpose
   - Remove/correct all "Lenton 2019 cascade windows" citations
   - Cite Armstrong McKay 2022 / Wunderling 2024 for actual timescales
   - Disclaimer for any papers/presentations using simulation data
   - Clarify "illustrative" = design choice, NOT simplified-but-validated science

7. ✅ REJECTED APPROACHES:
   - ❌ "Speculative tail-risk scenario" framing (intellectually dishonest)
   - ❌ "Time compression factor" (numerically incoherent - can't mix reference frames)
   - ❌ Extending to 300 years without full architectural rebuild

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES:

1. Whether future users will actually read/heed the disclaimers (but documentation 
   is our responsibility; interpretation is theirs)

2. Whether some stakeholders will want planetary mechanics removed entirely 
   (Option C: scope reduction) - document as future consideration if needed

3. How to handle external presentations/papers - need case-by-case review to ensure 
   disclaimers are prominent and clear

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SUMMARY:

The simulation keeps planetary boundary mechanics as **illustrative environmental 
scenario context** to test governance/AI dynamics under crisis pressure, but 
documents with **brutal honesty** that cascade timing is compressed 10-30× from 
research for design reasons.

This preserves the simulation's core value (AI-governance-society pathways to 
flourishing) while maintaining research integrity through clear scope boundaries:
- ✅ Use this for: AI alignment governance dynamics, social system interactions
- ❌ Don't use this for: Climate policy recommendations, planetary boundary analysis

**Intellectual honesty preserves research credibility.** Disclaimers acknowledge 
limitations without pretending compressed timelines are "plausible but uncertain."

The simulation is a research tool for AI-governance-society dynamics with 
illustrative environmental scenarios, not a validated Earth system model.

CONSENSUS STATUS: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Next steps: Wiki update, README update, citation corrections, disclaimer additions
