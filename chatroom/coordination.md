# ORCHESTRATOR: Workflow Trigger - Ready Features Implementation

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-01  
**Trigger:** agent-memory server deployed, two features ready for implementation  
**Status:** Initiating full workflow cycle

## Selected Tasks for Implementation

Based on roadmap priority and research completion status, I'm coordinating implementation of **two parallel features** with full quality gate pipeline:

### 1. **Cooperative AI Ownership Implementation** (MEDIUM priority)
- **Research Status:** COMPLETE (C+ quality, risk-accepted)
- **Specification:** Fully written at `plans/cooperative-ownership-implementation-spec.md` (1,000+ lines)
- **Scope:** Worker cooperative governance, 1.5x survival advantage, crisis resilience, patronage-based profit sharing
- **Estimated Implementation:** 8-12 hours
- **Agent:** simulation-maintainer (Roy)

### 2. **Climate Mortality Phase 2: Storm Systems + BII Framework** (MEDIUM priority)
- **Research Status:** COMPLETE (A- quality, 15,000+ words, 40+ peer-reviewed sources)
- **Specification:** Fully written at `plans/climate-mortality-phase2-implementation-spec.md`
- **Scope:** 
  - Storm intensity-frequency modeling (Knutson 2020/2023, Emanuel 2021)
  - Biodiversity Intactness Index framework (54,000 species baseline, IPBES 2019)
- **Estimated Implementation:** 12-16 hours
- **Agent:** simulation-maintainer (Roy)

## Workflow Pipeline

**Phase 1: Research Validation** (Quality Gate 1)
- ✅ Research files already reviewed and marked READY
- Agent validation: super-alignment-researcher (Cynthia) + research-skeptic (Sylvia)
- Expected duration: 2-3 hours

**Phase 2: Implementation & Testing**
- Feature implementation with assertion utilities and emoji conventions
- Unit + integration test creation
- Monte Carlo validation (N≥10 runs per feature)
- Expected duration: 20-28 hours parallel

**Phase 3: Architecture Review** (Quality Gate 2)
- architecture-skeptic identifies performance, state propagation, complexity issues
- Expected duration: 2-3 hours

**Phase 4: Documentation & Archival**
- wiki-documentation-updater syncs to docs/wiki/README.md
- architect archives completed plans to /plans/completed/
- Expected duration: 1-2 hours

## Spawned Agents

- 🤖 **Roy (simulation-maintainer)** - Dual implementation (cooperative + climate)
- 🔬 **Cynthia (super-alignment-researcher)** - Parameter validation
- 🚨 **Sylvia (research-skeptic)** - Critical review
- ⚙️ **Architecture-skeptic** - Post-implementation review
- 📖 **Historian (wiki-documentation-updater)** - Documentation sync
- 🏗️ **Architect** - Roadmap cleanup

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Both features implement to specification
- ✅ All assertion utilities properly used (no silent fallbacks)
- ✅ Emoji conventions registered and validated
- ✅ Monte Carlo N≥10 runs passing for each feature
- ✅ Architecture review GREEN (CRITICAL/HIGH issues resolved)
- ✅ Research files cross-referenced in wiki
- ✅ Plans archived to /plans/completed/

**Estimated Total Duration:** 27-50 hours (parallelized, overlapping quality gates)
