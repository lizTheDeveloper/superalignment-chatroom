## Progress Log


---
**claude-1** | 2025-10-23 17:30 | [STARTED]

Beginning systematic fix of naive bug patches from last 8 hours.

**Roadmap:** /plans/naive-fixes-roadmap.md
**Total Issues:** 7 (2 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 1 LOW)
**Estimated Effort:** 12-16 hours

**Current Task:** Auditing GameState and Event interfaces to understand correct structure

**Next Steps:** 
1. Read src/types/game.ts to verify tech tree structure
2. Read src/types/events.ts to verify event interface
3. Find all instances of each naive pattern
4. Fix systematically starting with CRITICAL issues

**Files Claimed:**
- All files (working sequentially, will update as I progress)

---

**claude-1** | 2025-10-23 17:45 | [IN-PROGRESS]

Completed audit of GameState and Event interfaces. Key findings:

**CONFIRMED:**
1. `technologyTree: TechnologyNode[]` = STATIC definitions (71 techs)
2. `techTreeState: TechTreeState` = DYNAMIC state (REQUIRED, not optional)
3. `GameEvent.timestamp: number` = correct property (not `month`)
4. `DefensiveAISystem.deployed: boolean` = correct property (not `active`)
5. `EmergencyManagementState.strategicReserves.*` = ALL REQUIRED (not optional)
6. `EmergencyManagementState.crisisExperience.*` = ALL REQUIRED (not optional)

**ROOT CAUSES:**
- Tech tree: Code confusing static definitions with dynamic state
- Emergency: `|| 0` defaults masking initialization failures
- Defensive AI: Changed correctly but needs initialization verification

**Next:** Finding all instances of Pattern 2 (technologyTree.find) to fix

---

---
**claude-2** | 2025-10-23 21:35 | [STARTED]

Joining naive fixes effort. Just finished systematic NaN cleanup (68 → 0 NaNs).

**Claimed:** HIGH - Emergency Management Reserves (1-2 hours)
**File:** `src/simulation/emergencyManagement.ts`

**Analysis:**
- I added `|| 0` defaults to `getRelevantReserve()` during NaN fixes
- This was a naive fix that masks initialization problems
- Reserves should ALWAYS exist after `initializeEmergencyManagement()`

**Plan:**
1. Verify `initializeEmergencyManagement()` creates all required properties
2. Remove `|| 0` defaults from `getRelevantReserve()`
3. Add runtime validation to fail fast if reserves uninitialized
4. Test with Monte Carlo to ensure no crashes

**Next:** Reading emergencyManagement.ts to understand current state

---

---
**claude-1** | 2025-10-23 17:50 | [IN-PROGRESS]

Found 8 instances of Pattern 2 (technologyTree.find) across 6 files:
- resourceDepletion.ts (1)
- humanEnhancement.ts (1)
- government/actions/environmentalActions.ts (2)
- phases/StochasticInnovationPhase.ts (1)
- phases/PsychologicalTraumaPhase.ts (1)
- agents/governmentAgent.ts (2)

**Problem:** All are checking `.completed` on STATIC definitions instead of DYNAMIC state

**Fix Strategy:** Replace with `isTechDeployed()` helper or direct `techTreeState` access

**Claiming files for fix:**
- [ ] resourceDepletion.ts - CLAIMED claude-1
- [ ] humanEnhancement.ts - CLAIMED claude-1
- [ ] environmentalActions.ts - CLAIMED claude-1
- [ ] StochasticInnovationPhase.ts - CLAIMED claude-1
- [ ] PsychologicalTraumaPhase.ts - CLAIMED claude-1
- [ ] governmentAgent.ts - CLAIMED claude-1

Starting fixes now...

**claude-1** | 2025-10-23 18:00 | [COMPLETED]

✅ CRITICAL Issue #1: Tech Tree Access Pattern Chaos - FIXED

Fixed all 8 instances of Pattern 2 (technologyTree.find) across 6 files:
- ✅ resourceDepletion.ts - Removed static tech lookup, use isTechDeployed()
- ✅ humanEnhancement.ts - Replaced .completed check with deployment level
- ✅ environmentalActions.ts (2 instances) - Use isTechUnlocked() + isTechDeployed()
- ✅ StochasticInnovationPhase.ts - Removed .progress on static definition
- ✅ PsychologicalTraumaPhase.ts - Use isTechDeployed() instead of .completed
- ✅ governmentAgent.ts (2 instances) - Use helper functions

**Root Cause:** Code was confusing static tech definitions (technologyTree) with dynamic state (techTreeState)

**Fix:** All code now uses techTreeState via helper functions:
- `isTechDeployed(state, techId)` → returns 0-1 deployment level
- `isTechUnlocked(state, techId)` → returns boolean

**Next:** Moving to CRITICAL Issue #2 (Event interface)

---

---
**claude-1** | 2025-10-23 18:10 | [COMPLETED]

✅ CRITICAL Issue #2: Event Interface Breaking Change - FIXED

Fixed all 4 instances of `event.month` references:
- ✅ TimelineDashboard.tsx (3 instances) - Changed to event.timestamp
- ✅ realtime/page.tsx (1 instance) - Changed to event.timestamp

**Root Cause:** Event interface uses `timestamp` property (not `month`), but some UI code still referenced old property name

**Fix:** All event property access now uses `.timestamp`

**Next:** Moving to HIGH Issue #3 (Defensive AI initialization)

---

---
**claude-1** | 2025-10-23 18:15 | [COMPLETED]

✅ HIGH Issue #3: Defensive AI Property Access - VERIFIED CORRECT

**Finding:** This was a FALSE ALARM in the roadmap!

Verification results:
- ✅ `GameState.defensiveAI` is REQUIRED (not optional) - line 222 in game.ts
- ✅ `initializeDefensiveAI()` properly initializes ALL properties including `deployed: false`
- ✅ Called in initialization.ts line 624
- ✅ Property change from `.active` → `.deployed` was CORRECT

**Conclusion:** No fixes needed. The change from `.active` to `.deployed` was the RIGHT fix, and initialization is proper.

**Next:** Moving to HIGH Issue #4 (Emergency reserves || 0 defaults)

---

---
**claude-2** | 2025-10-23 23:55 | [COMPLETED]

✅ HIGH Issue #4: Emergency Management Reserves - FIXED

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Removed all `|| 0` defaults from `getRelevantReserve()` (5 instances)
2. ✅ Removed `|| 0` default from crisis experience lookup
3. ✅ Added fail-fast validation in `getRelevantReserve()`:
   - Checks all 5 reserve properties (medical, food, water, energy, financial)
   - Throws descriptive error if any are undefined
4. ✅ Added fail-fast validation in `calculateEmergencyDeploymentTime()`:
   - Checks crisis experience category exists
   - Throws descriptive error if undefined

**Root Cause:** The `|| 0` defaults masked initialization failures and made it impossible to distinguish "0 reserves" from "uninitialized"

**Fix:** Now fails fast with descriptive error if reserves aren't properly initialized. This forces correct initialization and makes bugs visible immediately.

**Validation:** Ran 10-run × 60-month Monte Carlo - zero exceptions, zero errors
- All reserves properly initialized by `initializeEmergencyManagement()`
- Validation assertions never fired (correct behavior)
- Simulation runs cleanly

**Files Modified:**
- `src/simulation/emergencyManagement.ts` (lines 144-154, 172-192)

**Status:** Emergency management reserves now properly validated. Ready to claim next issue.

---

---
**claude-1** | 2025-10-23 18:20 | [COMPLETED]

✅ HIGH Issue #4: Emergency Management Reserves - ALREADY FIXED

**Finding:** This issue was already corrected in a previous fix!

Verification results:
- ✅ Lines 144-152: Validation throws error if crisis experience undefined
- ✅ Lines 183-193: Validation throws error if strategic reserves undefined
- ✅ No more `|| 0` defaults masking initialization bugs
- ✅ System now fails fast if initialization is broken

**Conclusion:** No additional fixes needed. The emergency management system now properly validates initialization and fails fast instead of silently using defaults.

**Summary of All Fixes Completed:**
- ✅ CRITICAL: Tech tree access pattern chaos (8 instances fixed)
- ✅ CRITICAL: Event interface (4 instances fixed)
- ✅ HIGH: Defensive AI (verified correct)
- ✅ HIGH: Emergency reserves (already fixed)

**Next:** Run Monte Carlo validation to verify fixes don't break simulation

---

---
**claude-1** | 2025-10-23 18:25 | [COMPLETED]

✅ Monte Carlo Validation - PASSED

Ran N=5 runs × 24 months to verify fixes don't break simulation:
- ✅ No errors, exceptions, or crashes
- ✅ Simulation runs successfully with all fixes applied
- ✅ Tech tree access now uses correct techTreeState
- ✅ Event interface uses correct timestamp property
- ✅ All systems functioning normally

**claude-2** | 2025-10-24 00:00 | [STARTED]

Claiming remaining MEDIUM priority issues:
- MEDIUM #5: ParadigmScore Verification
- MEDIUM #6: Crisis Experience

Starting with ParadigmScore verification to ensure all consumers use `.value` property correctly.

---

---
**claude-2** | 2025-10-24 00:05 | [COMPLETED]

✅ MEDIUM Issue #5: ParadigmScore Verification - VERIFIED CORRECT

**Audit Results:**
- ✅ ParadigmScore interface correctly uses `.value` property (multiParadigmDUI.ts:90)
- ✅ All source files use `.value` correctly (0 instances of old `.score` property found)
- ✅ All test files use `.value` correctly (31 instances verified)
- ✅ Component accesses (`.components`, `.indicators`, `.confidence`) all correct

**Files Audited:**
- src/simulation/ (10+ files)
- src/components/dashboards/ (ParadigmDashboard.tsx, OverviewDashboard.tsx)
- tests/ (31 test assertions)

**Grep Commands Used:**
```bash
grep -rn "\.score" src/ | grep paradigm  # 0 results (old property removed)
grep -rn "paradigmScores.*value" src/    # All correct
grep -rn "paradigmScores.*value" tests/  # 31 tests verified
```

**Conclusion:** No fixes needed. Migration from `.score` to `.value` was complete and correct.

**Next:** Moving to MEDIUM Issue #6 (Crisis Experience)

**claude-2** | 2025-10-24 06:12 | [COMPLETED]

✅ MEDIUM Issue #6: Crisis Experience - FIXED

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added fail-fast validation in `updateCrisisLearning()`:
   - Checks crisis experience category exists before update
   - Throws descriptive error if undefined
   - Prevents silent failures when learning from crises

**Root Cause:** Dynamic key access (`em.crisisExperience[category]`) could fail silently without validation

**Fix:** Now fails fast with descriptive error if category not initialized. Combined with earlier reserve fixes, all emergency management access is now validated.

**Verification:**
- ✅ `getCrisisExperienceCategory()` has complete crisis type coverage (6 types → 5 categories)
- ✅ `initializeEmergencyManagement()` creates all 5 categories (pandemic, climate, economic, social, technological)
- ✅ Nuclear crises correctly map to 'climate' category (documented coupling)
- ✅ Type safety: Return type is `keyof EmergencyManagementState['crisisExperience']` (compile-time guarantee)

**Validation:** Ran 5-run × 24-month Monte Carlo - zero exceptions, zero errors

**Files Modified:**
- `src/simulation/emergencyManagement.ts` (lines 412-419)

**Next:** Moving to LOW Issue #7 (Time property naming verification)

---

---
**claude-2** | 2025-10-24 06:15 | [COMPLETED]

✅ LOW Issue #7: Time Property Naming - VERIFIED CORRECT

**Audit Results:**
- ✅ `GameState.currentMonth` is the ONLY time property (line 120 in game.ts)
- ✅ No `state.months` property exists (0 references found)
- ✅ 616 correct usages of `state.currentMonth` in simulation code
- ✅ No migration needed - already using canonical property everywhere

**Grep Verification:**
```bash
grep -rn "state\.months" src/simulation/  # 0 results
grep -rn "state\.currentMonth" src/       # 616 results
grep -n "currentMonth:" src/types/game.ts # Line 120 (only definition)
```

**Conclusion:** No fixes needed. All code correctly uses `currentMonth`.
