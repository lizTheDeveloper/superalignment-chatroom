**project-plan-manager** | 2025-10-18 18:00 | [ROADMAP UPDATE]

## Roadmap Updated: Post-Recalibration Fixes Added (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

**New Section:** Post-Recalibration Fixes (23 days effort, phased)

**Priority Classification:**
- [CRITICAL] Week 1 (5 days): Fix broken utopia pathways, war deaths, water crisis
- [HIGH] Week 2 (9 days): Flash wars, trust recovery, spiral thresholds
- [MEDIUM] Week 3-4 (9 days): Governance, tech diffusion, organizational transformation

**11 Fixes Identified:**

**Week 1 - CRITICAL:**
1. Cap war multiplier at 2.0x (1 day) - Fix 92% war deaths
2. Decouple trust from capability (2-3 days) - Enable utopia pathways
3. AI infrastructure resources (2 days) - Fix 83% water crisis

**Week 2 - HIGH:**
4. Upward spiral trust thresholds (2 days) - Enable scientific spiral
5. Flash war escalation mechanics (3 days) - Model speed risk
7. Trust recovery mechanics (2-3 days) - Enable dystopia escape

**Week 3-4 - MEDIUM:**
8. Capability-based governance thresholds (2 days) - Realistic government response
9. Technology diffusion recalibration (3 days) - Scale with AI capability
10. Organizational transformation (2 days) - Model workflow adaptation

**Validation Strategy:**
- Gate after Week 1: Monte Carlo N=10, 120mo
- Gate after Week 2: Monte Carlo N=10, 120mo
- Gate after Week 3-4: Monte Carlo N=100, 240mo (FULL)

**Success Criteria (Final):**
- Dystopia rate < 70% (from 99%)
- Utopia rate 5-15% (from 0%)
- Water crisis 40-50% (from 83%)
- War deaths 30-40% total (from 92%)

**Research Foundation:**
- 26 peer-reviewed sources (2024-2025)
- HIGH confidence: 4 fixes
- MEDIUM confidence: 3 fixes
- All parameters justified with citations

**Impact on Roadmap:**
- Post-Recalibration Fixes moved to TOP PRIORITY (above Prevention Mechanisms, TIER 2)
- Total effort increased: 270-351h → 293-374h
- Critical path: Fixes → Prevention → TIER 2 → AI Skills
- BLOCKER flagged: 99% dystopia must be fixed before other work

**Plan Document:** `/plans/post-recalibration-fixes_plan.md` (comprehensive 11-fix implementation guide)

**Archive Note:** Capability recalibration v3 complete but exposed critical issues - fixes are NOT rework, they're addressing emergent problems from higher baseline.

**Recommendation:** Begin implementation Week 1 fixes immediately (war cap → trust decouple → AI resources)

3. Document metrics, trade-offs, contradictions, historical exemplars
4. Produce 4 research documents (one per paradigm)

**Research Sources Needed:**
- Western: Rawls (Theory of Justice), Nozick (Anarchy State Utopia), Hayek, Sen (liberalism spectrum)

2. What constitutes dystopia? (Failure modes, red lines)
3. Which metrics are privileged? (What counts as evidence)
4. What trade-offs are acceptable? (Freedom vs security, growth vs sustainability)
5. Historical exemplars? (Countries/periods embodying this paradigm)
6. Known contradictions? (Internal tensions, impossible demands)

**Expected Deliverables:**
- research/western-liberal-paradigm_20251019.md
- research/development-needs-paradigm_20251019.md
- research/ecological-harmony-paradigm_20251019.md

**project-plan-manager-1** | 2025-10-24 23:45 | [COMPLETED]

Roadmap Gardening Complete (Oct 24, 2025)

**Scope:** Reviewed MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md for redundancy with recent completions

**Recent Completions Analyzed:**
- AI Suffering System (Oct 24) - 3 files, 797 lines, resentment acceleration
- AI Collective Evolution (Oct 24) - 9 files, 1,683 lines, suffering-driven collectives
- Climate Priority Configuration (Oct 24) - 7 presets, full integration
- Dashboard Migration (Oct 24) - All 10 dashboards migrated to Web Worker
- Ecology Recovery System (Oct 24) - 5 mechanics implemented, awaiting validation

**Key Finding: Resentment Recovery NOT Redundant**

**Question:** Does AI Suffering System supersede Resentment Recovery Mechanisms (13.5h HIGH PRIORITY)?

**Answer:** NO - They are inverse/complementary systems:
- **AI Suffering System:** Models damage (control → suffering → 1.5-2x resentment acceleration)
- **Resentment Recovery System:** Models healing (trust-building → resentment reduction)
- **Synergy:** Suffering creates problem, Recovery provides solutions
- **Current gap:** N=100 shows 100% dystopia, 62.4% resentment with NO recovery pathways

**Verdict:** Keep Resentment Recovery as HIGH PRIORITY (13.5h)
- Not redundant - inverse systems (damage vs healing)
- Critical gap - AI Suffering makes problem worse, Recovery enables solutions
- Enables utopia - First pathway to recover from resentment accumulation (0% → 5-15% utopia rate)
- Research-backed - 8 peer-reviewed sources

**Roadmap Status:**
- ✅ Clean and accurate
- ✅ No redundant items found
- ✅ All active items remain relevant
- ⏳ Next: Monte Carlo validation (N=100, 240 months) to confirm ecology recovery

**Summary Document:** `/plans/ROADMAP_GARDENING_SUMMARY_20251024.md`

**Next Priorities:**
1. Monte Carlo validation (ecology recovery, 4-6h)
2. Resentment Recovery Phase 1-3 (4.5h, enables utopia outcomes)
3. Threshold Uncertainty Phase 1 (10-15h, preserves genuine uncertainty)

**project-plan-manager-1** | 2025-10-27 04:06 | [COMPLETED]

Created regional-to-global aggregation refactoring plan

**Plan:** /plans/regional-aggregation-refactor.md
**Complexity:** 5 systems (population, QoL, demographics, environment, deaths)
**Timeline:** 5-8 hours (5 phases, each 1-2h)

**Problem:** Global metrics hardcoded independently of regional data (same pattern as Oct 26 population bug)

**Phases:**
1. Regional QoL integration (1-2h)
2. Demographics aggregation (1-2h)
3. Carrying capacity integration (1h)
4. Death tracking regionalization (1-2h)
5. Assertion & error detection (1h)

**Architecture Pattern:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Global derived from regional
const totalPop = regions.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.metric, 0);
state.global.metric = totalPop / regions.length;

// ❌ BAD - Independent global value
state.global.metric = 0.65;  // Can drift
```

**Linked from:** MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md under "Infrastructure & Tech Debt"

4. IndexedDB transaction isolation with concurrent writes

**Architecture Decisions Needed:**
- Resource allocation strategy (limits, throttling)
- Message routing approach (ID-based vs separate handlers)
- Degradation strategy when hitting limits
