## AGREED POINTS

### 1. Simulation Systematically Overestimates Mortality

**Evidence:**
- **IPCC AR6 WGII:** +80M additional hunger risk by 2050 (SSP3-RCP6.0)
- **Simulation output:** 950M deaths @5yr, 7.76B deaths @30yr
- **Discrepancy:** 10,000× for 30-year projection

**Conclusion:** This exceeds all peer-reviewed climate/ecology literature projections, including nuclear winter scenarios (Robock et al. 2007: 70% mortality @10yr).

### 2. Extinction Rate Modeling Exceeds IPBES Bounds

**Evidence:**
- **IPBES 2019:** Current extinction 10-100× baseline, accelerating
- **Simulation output:** 170-270× baseline extinction threshold
- **Assessment:** Upper bound exceeds even worst-case IPBES projections

**Conclusion:** Biosphere integrity modeling may have multiplicative cascade bug.

### 3. Agricultural Yield Loss → Mortality Conversion Likely Overcalibrated

**Evidence:**
- **Nelson et al. (2014):** 11-17% yield loss by 2050 (RCP8.5)
- **Zhao et al. (2017):** -3.2% to -7.4% per 1°C warming (4 major crops)
- **IPCC food security:** 80M additional hunger risk, NOT billion-scale mortality

**Conclusion:** Famine mortality conversion rate needs audit against historical data. Severe historical famines: ~1% population loss, not 95%.

### 4. Adaptation Efficacy Likely Underweighted or Missing

**Evidence:**
- **Nelson et al.:** Economic adaptation reduces yield loss from 17% → 11%
- **IPCC AR6:** "Depends significantly on adaptation measures"
- **Zhao et al.:** Projections assume "NO adaptation, NO genetic improvement"

**Conclusion:** Simulation may not model adaptive capacity documented in literature.

## SUSPECTED ROOT CAUSES

### Hypothesis 1: Multiplicative Cascade Bug (MOST LIKELY)
```
❌ BAD: famine_deaths = base × climate_factor × ecosystem_factor × pollution_factor
✅ GOOD: famine_deaths = base + climate_effect + ecosystem_effect + pollution_effect
```
Multiplicative compounding creates exponential explosion not supported by literature.

### Hypothesis 2: Missing Adaptation Modeling
Literature assumes incremental adaptation, CO2 fertilization, genetic improvement. If simulation excludes these, it models implausible "zero response" scenario.

### Hypothesis 3: Circular Dependency or NaN Propagation
Similar to Oct 24 ecology NaN bug - silent error accumulation producing physically impossible results.

## REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES

1. **Actual temperature trajectory in simulation:** What warming level by 2030, 2050?
2. **Cascade interaction structure:** Additive, multiplicative, or threshold-based?
3. **Adaptation implementation:** Does sim include adaptive responses documented in IPCC?
4. **Breakthrough tech deployment:** Are AI-enabled solutions modeled?

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Calibration Audit)
1. ✅ **Audit cascade multiplication logic** - Check for multiplicative vs additive
2. ✅ **Validate famine mortality conversion** - Compare to historical famine data
3. ✅ **Check adaptation efficacy** - Does model include IPCC adaptation assumptions?
4. ✅ **Recalibrate to IPCC benchmarks** - Match AR6 WGII hunger projections @2050

### Medium-term (Model Enhancement)
5. Add uncertainty ranges (Monte Carlo sweeps over parameter distributions)
6. Implement adaptation response curves from Nelson et al. 2014
7. Add CO2 fertilization effects from Zhao et al. 2017
8. Model breakthrough tech deployment pathways

### Validation
9. Re-run N=100 Monte Carlo after fixes
10. Compare outputs to IPCC SSP1, SSP3, SSP5 scenarios
11. Validate extinction rates against IPBES 2019 bounds

## CONSENSUS STATEMENT

**Cynthia's optimistic interpretation:** The simulation is a valuable tool for exploring intervention pathways, BUT it currently overshoots peer-reviewed projections by orders of magnitude. This doesn't invalidate the tool - it identifies where the model needs fixing. Once calibrated, it can still show meaningful 80M+ hunger risk that breakthrough tech could prevent.

**Sylvia's skeptical verdict:** The 10,000× mortality discrepancy indicates systematic overestimation, likely from multiplicative cascade bugs or missing adaptation modeling. Cannot endorse current projections without calibration. The simulation needs research-backed parameter grounding before results are credible.

**We agree:** Simulation requires immediate calibration audit. Current outputs are implausible and should not be used for decision-making until validated against IPCC/IPBES benchmarks.

## SIGNATURE

✅ Cynthia (optimistic researcher) - AGREED
✅ Sylvia (skeptical reviewer) - AWAITING CONFIRMATION

**Status:** Consensus pending Sylvia's final review. If she confirms, debate loop ends and hands off to orchestrator for calibration implementation.
