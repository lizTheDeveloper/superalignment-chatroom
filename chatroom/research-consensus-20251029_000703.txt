CONSENSUS REACHED - Policy Variance Diagnostic Framework
Date: 2025-10-29
Debaters: Cynthia (optimist) + Sylvia (skeptic)
Topic: Crisis mitigation mechanics vs diagnostic-first approach

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AGREED POINTS:

1. ✅ DIAGNOSIS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION
   - Cannot design solutions without understanding root cause
   - Cynthia acknowledged skipping diagnostic phase (went straight to proposing mechanics)
   - Sylvia's 4 diagnostic tests are mandatory before any implementation

2. ✅ FOUR DIAGNOSTIC TESTS REQUIRED:
   - Test 1: Chaos vs Noise (seeds 42000-42004, check trajectory divergence)
   - Test 2: Job Guarantee Audit (find source of 10.2% unemployment)
   - Test 3: Outcome Classification (document actual thresholds, check reachability)
   - Test 4: Breakthrough Propagation (trace fusion → QoL/ecology → outcome score)

3. ✅ BUGS MUST BE FIXED FIRST:
   - Population extraction bug (0.00B) is critical
   - Outcome scoring must be audited (100% Status Quo suggests broken detection)
   - Breakthrough propagation must be traced (are effects actually applied?)

4. ✅ CONDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Crisis response mechanics (automatic stabilizers, feedback loops) are ONLY appropriate IF diagnosis confirms missing mechanisms
   - If root cause is bugs/broken scoring/RNG issues, fix those instead
   - Cynthia's research framework (GAO stabilizers, Nature Sustainability tipping points, Regenerative Economics feedback loops) is sound BUT premature

5. ✅ SYLVIA'S CONDITIONAL AGREEMENT:
   - IF diagnostics show: (1) variance from economic shocks not bugs, (2) thresholds are reachable, (3) breakthroughs propagate, (4) feedback loops missing
   - THEN crisis response mechanics are appropriate solution
   - Cynthia's research applies in that scenario

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES:

1. ❓ Is 71.5% CV from CHAOS (sensitive dependence) or NOISE (independent shocks)?
   - Matters for solution design (feedback loops vs RNG strategy)
   - Cynthia argues distinction is less important (both need shock absorption)
   - Sylvia argues it's critical (different root causes → different fixes)
   - RESOLVE: Run Test 1 to determine empirically

2. ❓ Is Job Guarantee 0% CV a FEATURE (designed stability) or BUG (hard-coded value)?
   - Cynthia: Real JG programs show 2-3% variance (low is realistic)
   - Sylvia: 0% is suspicious, likely implementation issue
   - RESOLVE: Run Test 2 to inspect code

3. ❓ Why is outcome distribution 100% Status Quo?
   - Hypothesis A (Cynthia): Connectivity problem (broken pipes between systems)
   - Hypothesis B (Sylvia): Broken scoring OR missing mechanisms
   - RESOLVE: Run Tests 3 & 4 to trace data flow + check thresholds

4. ❓ Do automatic stabilizers belong in the model?
   - Cynthia: Always relevant (present in all real economies)
   - Sylvia: Premature without diagnosis (might mask bugs)
   - RESOLVE: Decision contingent on diagnostic findings

5. ❓ Are negative feedback loops MISSING or MISCALIBRATED?
   - Cynthia proposed adding wage-employment adjustment, price mechanisms
   - Sylvia asks: Have you checked if they already exist?
   - RESOLVE: Code audit required before proposing new mechanics

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

PHASE 1 - DIAGNOSTIC WORK (Cynthia commits to this):

1. Run chaos vs noise test:
   ```bash
   for seed in 42000 42001 42002 42003 42004; do
     npx tsx scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts --seed $seed --runs 1 --months 120
   done
   ```
   Analysis: Plot unemployment trajectories, check for divergence vs independence

2. Job Guarantee code inspection:
   ```bash
   grep -r "10.2\|jobGuarantee" src/simulation/ --include="*.ts" -A 10
   ```
   Document: Line numbers, calculation logic, fiscal constraints

3. Outcome classification audit:
   ```bash
   grep -r "classifyOutcome\|determineOutcome\|Utopia\|Dystopia" src/simulation/engine.ts -A 20
   ```
   Document: Thresholds for each outcome tier, input variables, reachability

4. Breakthrough propagation trace:
   ```bash
   grep -r "fusion" src/simulation/techTree/ -A 30
   ```
   Trace: techTree activation → effectsEngine → state updates → outcome scoring

PHASE 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION:

After diagnostic work, reconvene to interpret findings:
- IF chaos + broken scoring → Fix scoring, then add feedback loops
- IF noise + broken scoring → Fix scoring, evaluate RNG strategy
- IF chaos + correct scoring → Add feedback loops + connectivity fixes
- IF noise + correct scoring → Debate stabilizers (Cynthia yes, Sylvia conditional)

PHASE 3 - SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION:

Priority order:
1. Fix bugs (population extraction, NaN propagation)
2. Fix broken systems (scoring, connectivity)
3. Add missing mechanics ONLY if diagnosis supports it

Deliverable:
- Diagnostic report with findings + code references + trajectory plots
- Evidence-based recommendation (fix bugs vs add mechanics)
- Implementation specification ONLY if Phase 2 confirms missing mechanisms

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUMMARY:

Sylvia correctly identified that Cynthia jumped to solutions before diagnosis. Cynthia's research on crisis response mechanics (automatic stabilizers, bimodal branching, negative feedback loops) is well-sourced and intellectually sound, but PREMATURE without understanding root cause.

CONSENSUS: Run 4 diagnostic tests first, THEN decide on solutions based on evidence. Crisis response mechanics may be appropriate IF diagnostics confirm missing mechanisms, but might be unnecessary IF root cause is bugs/broken scoring/RNG issues.

Next step: Cynthia runs diagnostic tests and reports findings with evidence, not assumptions.

DEBATE OUTCOME: Consensus via Sylvia's critical scrutiny catching premature solution design. Evidence-based optimism means diagnosing first, implementing second.
