# Task Specification: Ecological Recovery System Validation

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Agent:** research-skeptic
**Type:** Quality Gate 1 (Research Validation)
**Priority:** URGENT

---

## Context

**Problem:** N=100 240-month validation shows 86% mortality despite:
- Western Liberal: 50.3/100 (democracy recovered)
- Development: 74.6/100 (near utopia)
- **Ecological: 1.3/100** ← ROOT CAUSE OF COLLAPSE

All 9 planetary boundaries breached = ecological collapse = 86% mortality.

**Solution Proposed:** 3-tier planetary boundary recovery system

---

## Documents to Review

1. **Design Document:** `/plans/ecological-recovery-system-design.md` (10,800 words)
2. **Research Foundation:** `/research/planetary_boundary_reversibility_empirical_20251020.md` (20+ peer-reviewed sources)

---

## Validation Checklist

### 1. Empirical Grounding

**Question:** Are recovery timescales research-backed?

**Tier 1 (Reversible):**
- Ozone: 40-70 years (Montreal Protocol evidence)
- Freshwater: 10-30 years (aquifer recharge)
- Atmospheric aerosols: 1-5 years (atmospheric turnover)

**Tier 2 (Partial):**
- Climate: 50-100 years with CDR (IPCC AR6 overshoot scenarios)
- Phosphorus: 30-50 years with input reduction + legacy cleanup (Lake Erie struggle)
- Land system: 30-100 years (tree cover vs ecosystem function)

**Tier 3 (Irreversible):**
- Extinction: Permanent (cannot resurrect species)
- Deep ocean acidification: 300+ years, never fully recovers (15-18% more acidic permanently)
- PFAS: Permanent ("forever chemicals")

**Validation:** Do timescales match peer-reviewed sources (±25%)?

---

### 2. Mechanism Validation

**Question:** Are recovery mechanisms realistic?

**Progressive Scoring:**
- Gives credit for recovery progress before full un-breach
- Example: Climate recovers 50% if temp <1.5°C for 12 months (even if boundary still breached)

**Technology Prerequisites:**
- Direct Air Capture (TIER 3) - CDR at gigatonne scale
- Struvite Recovery (TIER 1) - 98% phosphorus recovery from wastewater
- Desalination (TIER 2) - Freshwater augmentation

**Policy Prerequisites:**
- Government investment (Montreal Protocol-level cooperation)
- Enforcement capacity >0.7
- International cooperation >0.7

**Sustained Improvement:**
- Freshwater: 15 years (180 months) sustained improvement
- Climate: 24 months below 1.5°C with net-negative emissions
- Phosphorus: 60 months with 40% input reduction + cleanup

**Validation:** Do mechanisms have real-world precedents?

---

### 3. Pollyanna Bias Check

**Question:** Is design too optimistic about recovery?

**Potential Over-Optimism:**
1. **Legacy contamination barriers**
   - Sediment phosphorus releases 11,000 metric tons/year (= total river inputs)
   - Lake Erie re-eutrophication despite 50-70% input reduction

2. **Governance capacity requirements**
   - Assumes Montreal Protocol-level cooperation possible
   - 197 parties ratified ozone treaty - can this be replicated for 9 boundaries?

3. **Thermodynamic constraints**
   - Deep ocean circulation takes centuries (300+ years)
   - Carbonate chemistry hysteresis prevents full recovery

4. **Economic resistance**
   - Tragedy of commons (millions of farms, not one factory)
   - Farmers bear costs, public gets benefits
   - "Not In My Backyard" resistance to intervention

**Validation:** Does design acknowledge barriers honestly?

---

### 4. Missing Mechanisms

**Question:** What's NOT in the design but should be?

**Potential Gaps:**
1. **Climate feedbacks accelerating degradation**
   - Warmer temps → more algal blooms (even with same phosphorus)
   - Permafrost thaw → carbon release → warming feedback

2. **Tipping point cascades preventing recovery**
   - Amazon rainforest dieback → reduced CO₂ uptake → warming
   - AMOC shutdown → regional climate shifts → ecosystem stress

3. **Political barriers to sustained action**
   - 10-20 year recovery timelines exceed electoral cycles
   - Policy reversal risk (Trump pulling out of Paris Agreement)

4. **Rebound effects from partial recovery**
   - Ozone recovery → HFC use → warming (Kigali Amendment needed)
   - Freshwater recovery → more consumption → re-depletion

**Validation:** Are these gaps addressed or ignored?

---

### 5. Score Weighting Justification

**Question:** Are weights empirically grounded?

**Proposed Weights:**
- Climate: 20% (most important, hardest to fix)
- Biosphere: 20% (extinction permanent, high impact)
- Ocean acidification: 15% (partial recovery only)
- Land system: 10%
- Phosphorus: 10%
- Freshwater: 10%
- Novel entities: 10%
- Aerosols: 5% (least important, easiest to fix)

**Alternative Weighting Logic:**
- Should irreversible boundaries (extinction, PFAS) be weighted HIGHER (permanent damage)?
- Should reversible boundaries (aerosols, freshwater) be weighted LOWER (fixable)?

**Validation:** Are weights justified by impact severity or empirical evidence?

---

## Success Criteria

### PASS Conditions:
- ✅ Recovery timescales match peer-reviewed sources (±25%)
- ✅ Mechanisms have real-world precedents (Montreal Protocol, Lake Erie)
- ✅ Acknowledges irreversibility honestly (no resurrection, no deep ocean recovery)
- ✅ Weights justified by impact severity or empirical evidence
- ✅ Missing mechanisms identified but not critical gaps

### FAIL Conditions:
- ❌ Science fiction creep (de-extinction, nanotechnology cleanup, geoengineering miracles)
- ❌ Cherry-picked optimistic studies (ignoring contradictory evidence)
- ❌ Ignores thermodynamic constraints (deep ocean, PFAS persistence)
- ❌ Overstates government capacity (assumes Montreal Protocol always possible)
- ❌ Critical missing mechanisms (climate feedbacks, tipping cascades)

---

## Critical Question

**Can humanity ACTUALLY reverse these boundaries once breached, or is prevention the only strategy?**

The design claims:
- Some boundaries ARE reversible (ozone, freshwater, aerosols)
- Some boundaries are PARTIAL (climate surface, phosphorus with cleanup, land with time)
- Some boundaries are IRREVERSIBLE (extinction, deep ocean, PFAS)

**Is this empirically defensible?**

## Agent Context

**research-skeptic role:**
- Identify pollyanna bias and over-optimism
- Check for science fiction creep
- Validate empirical grounding
- Ensure thermodynamic/political realism
- Recommend conservative parameter estimates

**Key mindset:** Recovery from 86% mortality is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Be skeptical of easy solutions.
