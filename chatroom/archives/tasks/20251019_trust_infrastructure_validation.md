# Research Task Specification: Trust & Infrastructure Parameter Validation

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Requester:** Orchestrator
**Agent:** Super-Alignment-Researcher
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks implementation of Fixes #2-4

---

## Context

Research-skeptic has identified that implemented Fixes #2-4 from post-recalibration work contain parameters that contradict or lack empirical grounding in 2024 research. We need a deep literature review to either:
1. **Confirm** skeptic's critique with additional sources
2. **Challenge** skeptic's critique with contradictory evidence
3. **Refine** parameter ranges with empirical data

## Research Questions

### TOPIC 1: Trust in AI Systems

**Core Question:** What drives public trust in AI/automation according to 2024-2025 empirical research?

**Specific Issues to Address:**

1. **Explainability vs Performance**
   - Does explainability increase trust? (Skeptic cites Scientific Reports 2024: "NO")
   - What's the relative weight of performance vs. explanation?
   - Context-dependent effects (high-stakes vs low-stakes domains)

2. **Trust Drivers Ranking**
   - What factors matter most? (Skeptic: performance > benefits > safety > alignment)
   - Empirical weights from surveys/experiments
   - Longitudinal studies showing trust dynamics over time

3. **Trust Growth and Decay Rates**
   - How fast does trust decline when problems occur?
   - How fast does trust recover with improvements?
   - Asymmetry effects (fast loss, slow recovery?)

**Required Sources:**
- 3+ peer-reviewed empirical studies (2024-2025)
- Preference for large-N surveys or experimental data
- Look for meta-analyses if available

**Output:** Parameter ranges for trust formula components with confidence intervals

### TOPIC 2: AI Infrastructure Resource Consumption

**Core Question:** What are realistic water and energy consumption values for AI systems?

**Specific Issues to Address:**

1. **Water Consumption - Training**
   - Liters per training run for different model sizes
   - Validation of UC Riverside 700K-5.4M L estimate
   - One-time vs recurring costs

2. **Water Consumption - Inference/Deployment**
   - Liters per day/month for operational AI systems
   - Validation of Google 2.1M L/day for hyperscale DC
   - Scaling with capability increases

3. **Energy Consumption**
   - MW per FLOP for training vs inference
   - Data center PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) trends 2024
   - Regional variation (cooling requirements)

4. **Scaling Behavior**
   - Linear vs logarithmic efficiency gains
   - Evidence for/against 50M L/month per capability point
   - Improvements from recycling/efficiency tech

**Required Sources:**
- 2+ peer-reviewed studies or government reports
- Industry data from Google, Microsoft, AWS (2024 reports)
- Environmental impact assessments

**Output:** Separate training vs inference consumption with scaling curves

### TOPIC 3: Workflow Adaptation & Organizational AI Adoption

**Core Question:** How do organizations actually adopt and integrate AI into workflows?

**Specific Issues to Address:**

1. **Baseline Adoption Rates**
   - Validation of 21% baseline (McKinsey/IBM 2024)
   - Current state as of 2024-2025
   - Sector variation (tech vs manufacturing vs services)

2. **Adoption Thresholds**
   - Is 40% a meaningful threshold? (Skeptic: arbitrary)
   - Tipping points in diffusion research
   - Critical mass theory evidence

3. **Growth Dynamics**
   - Linear vs S-curve adoption patterns
   - Evidence for bimodal distribution (Autor 2024)
   - Resistance factors and failure rates

4. **Training Capacity Constraints**
   - How fast can workforce retrain?
   - Effectiveness by socioeconomic status
   - Organizational learning rates

**Required Sources:**
- 3+ studies on technology adoption (preferably AI-specific)
- Labor economics research (Autor, Acemoglu, etc.)
- Organizational change management research

**Output:** Growth model specification (S-curve? logistic?) with parameter values
