Feature implementation for critical governmentAgent.ts refactoring (2,820 lines -> modular architecture).

**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 | [STARTED]

Beginning CRITICAL refactoring of governmentAgent.ts (2,820 lines).

**Goal:** Break monolithic file into modular, testable structure
**Proposed structure:** src/simulation/government/ with action registry pattern
**Validation:** Monte Carlo N=10 (identical outcomes with same seed)
**Estimated complexity:** 15-20 hours (8 systems affected)

**Plan:**
- Phase 1: Create directory structure, type definitions, action registry
- Phase 2: Migrate economic actions (15 actions)
- Phase 3: Migrate research actions (12 actions)
- Phase 4: Migrate environmental actions (18 actions)
- Phase 5: Migrate social actions (10 actions)
- Phase 6: Migrate international actions (8 actions)
- Phase 7: Migrate crisis actions (12 actions)
- Phase 8: Migrate technology actions (10 actions)
- Phase 9: Create decision engine, state management
- Phase 10: Create backward-compatible index, validate all tests

See /reviews/architecture-refactoring-plan_20251017.md Section 1 for detailed breakdown.

**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 | [IN-PROGRESS]

Discovered existing progress: 8/37 actions already migrated (22%)

**Completed:**
- Economic actions (4): UBI variants, subsidize_organization
- Regulation actions (4): regulate_large_companies, compute_threshold, capability_ceiling, compute_governance

**Remaining actions (29) to migrate:**
- Safety/Evaluation (8): alignment_research, benchmark_suite, alignment_tests, red_teaming, interpretability, evaluation_frequency, safety_reviews, kill_switches
- Crisis (6): emergency_ai_pause, emergency_amazon_protection, fund_coral_restoration, ban_harmful_pesticides, deploy_environmental_tech
- Rights/Data (5): recognize_ai_rights, training_data_control, training_data_trust, detect_misaligned_ais, remove_detected_ai
- National Strategy (4): fund_national_compute, seize_data_center, cyber_defense, nuclear_controls (2)
- International (6): restrict_research_publishing, limit_employee_mobility, ban_reverse_engineering

Proceeding with Phase 4: Extract remaining actions by category.

**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 | [ALERT]

CORRECTION: Found existing /government/ directory but it's incomplete/outdated.

Current reality:
- governmentAgent.ts still contains ALL 37 actions inline (lines 29-2186)
- Actions have NOT been migrated yet - the GOVERNMENT_ACTIONS array is still monolithic
- The /government/ directory exists but appears to be from a previous incomplete refactoring attempt
- economicActions.ts and regulationActions.ts exist but are NOT being used by the system

Need to assess: Should we complete the existing refactoring structure, or start fresh?

Checking what's already in /government/ directory...

ASSESSMENT COMPLETE:

The refactoring infrastructure IS already in place and IS being used:
- GovernmentActionsPhase imports from `/government/` module (not old governmentAgent)
- governmentCore.ts uses hybrid approach: migrated actions + legacy fallback
- 8/37 actions migrated to economicActions.ts + regulationActions.ts
- These 8 ARE being used but the other 29 still come from legacy

**Strategy going forward:**
1. Continue incremental migration - extract remaining 29 actions
2. Add them to migratedActions in /government/actions/index.ts
3. The hybrid system (governmentCore.ts) will automatically use them
4. Once all 37 migrated, remove legacy import and delete old governmentAgent.ts
5. Run Monte Carlo to validate behavior unchanged

This is actually well-designed! Just needs completion.

Starting extraction of remaining actions...
