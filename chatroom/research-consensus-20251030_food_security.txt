CONSENSUS REACHED: P3.2 UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS CALIBRATION
Date: October 30, 2025
Participants: Sylvia (research skeptic), Cynthia (super-alignment researcher)
Rounds: 5

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AGREED POINTS:

1. BASE PROBABILITY: 0.15% monthly (1.8% annual)
   - Expected outcome: ~1 simulation-affecting event per 20-year run
   - Derived from: 2-3 unprecedented events per 20 years × 50% filter for simulation-affecting
   - Rationale: Not all "unprecedented" events affect simulation (9/11, SARS were minor)

2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK: Ord (2020) quantified low-probability events
   - "Unexpected manifestations of known risks" vs Taleb's unpredictable black swans
   - Maintains modeling coherence while capturing genuine surprise

3. TEMPLATE SELECTION: Uniform distribution (10% per template)
   - Honest uncertainty - no historical frequency data to justify differential weighting
   - Avoids fabricating probabilities

4. TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION: Linear spread over research-backed durations
   - Economic shocks: 24 months (Reinhart & Rogoff, 2009)
   - Pandemic impacts: 18 months (empirical COVID data)
   - Simple, defensible, avoids over-engineering

5. IMPACT MAGNITUDES: Historical precedents (~1/10th original estimates)
   - COVID-19: -0.08% mortality (not -5%)
   - 2008 crisis: -5% GDP over 2y (not -20%)
   - Spanish Flu: -1-2% mortality (not -10%)
   - Fixes catastrophism bias

6. MINIMUM IMPACT THRESHOLD (implicit): ≥1% GDP OR ≥0.01% mortality
   - Filters out psychologically shocking but simulation-negligible events
   - 9/11 (0.001% mortality) = negligible
   - 2008 crisis (-5% GDP) = major

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES:

1. Template probability distribution may evolve
   - As more historical data becomes available, uniform may be replaced with empirical
   - Current uniform = honest uncertainty, not final answer

2. Minimum impact thresholds may need recalibration
   - ≥1% GDP and ≥0.01% mortality are initial estimates
   - Monte Carlo validation will reveal if too strict/loose

3. Temporal distribution may be template-specific
   - Current: 24mo economic, 18mo pandemic
   - Future: Could differentiate by event type (cyber vs climate vs pandemic)

4. Interaction effects not modeled
   - Multiple simultaneous unprecedented events (e.g., pandemic + financial crisis)
   - Cascading effects (climate → food → conflict)
   - Phase dependencies currently assume independence

SUMMARY:

After 5 rounds of debate, we converged on a defensible calibration for P3.2 Unknown Unknowns:

**Core insight:** "Unprecedented" (psychologically shocking) ≠ "simulation-affecting" (economically/demographically significant). The 50% filter between these categories is empirically grounded (2 of 4 recent unprecedented events were simulation-affecting).

**Implementation change:** BASE_PROBABILITY = 0.0015 (0.15% monthly), down from 0.003. This achieves ~1 simulation-affecting event per 20-year run, matching historical frequency while avoiding catastrophism.

**Validation required:** N≥100 Monte Carlo runs to check outcome distribution. If dystopia convergence persists, issue is elsewhere (not Unknown Unknowns).

**Key methodology:** Started with Taleb's black swans (unmodelingable), pivoted to Ord's quantified low-probability events (modelable), grounded in historical precedents (COVID, 2008 crisis, Spanish Flu), filtered for simulation relevance.

This debate demonstrates the value of adversarial research review. Cynthia's optimism found the framework, Sylvia's skepticism found the problems, together we created defensible parameters.

IMPLEMENTATION READY: YES

Next step: simulation-maintainer agent implements changes with proper assertion utilities and Monte Carlo validation (N≥100).
