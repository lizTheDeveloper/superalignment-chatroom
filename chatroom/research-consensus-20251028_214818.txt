CONSENSUS REACHED: Mortality Projections Validation (Cynthia + Sylvia)
Date: 2025-10-29 04:45

## AGREED POINTS

1. **Simulation mortality projections are 500-1000× too high**
   - Simulation: 7.76B deaths (95.4%) over 30 years (2025-2055)
   - Peer-reviewed literature: 7.5M-14.5M deaths over same period
   - Even pessimistic "Climate Endgame" (Kemp 2022): ~800M worst explored case by 2070

2. **No mechanistic pathway supports billion-scale mortality by 2055**
   - WHO/IPCC: ~250K additional deaths/year (climate-related)
   - WEF cascading risks: 14.5M total by 2050
   - Biosphere integrity crossing ≠ immediate human extinction
   - Agricultural yield losses (even 24%) ≠ total famine mortality

3. **Timelines are compressed**
   - Literature: Major impacts POST-2050, accelerating toward 2070-2100
   - Simulation: Front-loading catastrophe to 2025-2055 window
   - Kemp "2 billion at risk" projection: 2070 (not 2055)

4. **Likely calibration bugs**
   - Cascades compounding exponentially (should be sublinear)
   - No adaptation discount (literature assumes 20-50% mortality reduction)
   - Mortality sources double-counting (overlap not recognized)
   - Biosphere threshold treated as binary cliff (should be gradual)

5. **Pattern matches Oct 24 ecology NaN bug**
   - Different root cause, same symptom: Physically implausible outputs
   - Silent compounding errors producing unvalidated extremes
   - Research simulation must fail loudly when parameters exceed literature bounds

## REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES

1. **What are IPCC AR6 scenario-specific mortality projections?**
   - Need SSP5-8.5 mortality estimates for 2025-2055 period
   - WHO baseline found (250K/year), need IPCC scenario breakdown

2. **Agricultural yield → famine → mortality conversion rates**
   - Need Nelson et al. 2014, Zhao et al. 2017 mechanistic models
   - How much crop failure causes how many deaths? (with adaptation)

3. **Cascade interaction terms**
   - Are effects currently multiplicative? (exponential explosion)
   - Should be sublinear (vulnerable populations die first, then marginal mortality drops)

4. **Adaptation efficacy parameters**
   - Even worst-case IPCC scenarios assume SOME adaptation
   - What % mortality reduction from realistic interventions?

5. **Root cause in simulation code**
   - Which phase/system is generating 1000× overshoot?
   - Is it bayesianMortality? Cascade compounding? Regional populations?
   - Need code audit to identify where calibration diverges from literature

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

**BLOCK implementation until:**

1. ✅ Extract mortality parameters from IPCC AR6 WGII (SSP scenarios)
2. ✅ Model cascades as sublinear (diminishing marginal mortality)
3. ✅ Add adaptation efficacy discount (20-50% reduction minimum)
4. ✅ Validate Monte Carlo outcomes match literature:
   - 5-year dystopia rate: ~5-15% (not 82%)
   - 30-year catastrophic mortality: ~10-50M (not 7.76B)
   - Biosphere 170-270× triggers ecosystem degradation, not extinction

5. ✅ Add assertion utilities for mortality bounds checking:
   ```typescript
   assertMortalityWithinBounds(totalDeaths, {
     maxDeathsPerYear: 50_000_000, // 50M/year = extreme upper bound
     literatureSource: "Kemp 2022 Climate Endgame worst explored case",
     location: "BayesianMortalityResolutionPhase"
   });
   ```

## SUMMARY

Sylvia correctly identified that the simulation is producing mortality estimates **beyond the explored frontier of climate science** - not pessimistic-but-plausible, but physically implausible given peer-reviewed literature.

Cynthia's research confirms: Even the most catastrophic explored scenarios (Kemp 2022 "Climate Endgame", WEF cascading risks, IPCC worst-case) project 2-3 orders of magnitude LOWER mortality than the simulation for the 2025-2055 period.

**This is a critical calibration error** requiring immediate attention. The simulation is a research tool - outputs must be defensible against peer-reviewed literature or the entire project loses scientific credibility.

**Next steps:**
1. Route to `super-alignment-researcher` to extract IPCC AR6 mortality parameters
2. Route to `simulation-maintainer` to audit cascade compounding logic
3. Route to `architecture-skeptic` after fix to validate no other systems have 1000× calibration errors

**Status: Implementation BLOCKED pending parameter validation and calibration fix.**
