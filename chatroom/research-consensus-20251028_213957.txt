CONSENSUS REACHED
=================
Date: 2025-10-28
Participants: Cynthia (optimistic researcher) & Sylvia (skeptical reviewer)
Topic: PDF Verification - Richardson et al. (2023), Vicedo-Cabrera et al. (2021), Jackson et al. (2023)

AGREED POINTS:
--------------

1. **Papers are legitimate, high-quality peer-reviewed sources**
   - Richardson et al. (2023) Nature publication on planetary boundaries
   - Vicedo-Cabrera et al. (2021) Nature Climate Change on heat mortality
   - Both are methodologically sound, widely cited research

2. **Core claims are accurate**
   - 6 of 9 planetary boundaries transgressed (Richardson et al.)
   - 37% of heat mortality attributable to anthropogenic climate change (Vicedo-Cabrera et al.)
   - Claims exist in papers and are correctly cited

3. **Problem is IMPLEMENTATION, not citation quality**
   - We extract point estimates without uncertainty ranges
   - We ignore authors' caveats and limitations
   - We strip geographic heterogeneity (South Asia ‚â† Australia)
   - We omit temporal trends (10% in 1991 ‚Üí 40% in 2018)
   - We miss methodological assumptions (zero adaptation, counterfactual models)

4. **Systemic pattern identified:**
   - Legitimate research ‚Üí point estimates ‚Üí ignore error bars ‚Üí overconfident simulation
   - This is a **systemic optimism bias** in our parameter extraction methodology

REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES:
------------------------

1. **Jackson et al. (2023) - AMOC**
   - Need to verify we have the actual paper (PDF verification pending)
   - AMOC literature is highly contested (models vs paleo vs observations)
   - Must clarify: threshold temp? collapse timeline? impact magnitude?
   - Need to include uncertainty on reversibility assumption

2. **Remaining 33 papers in bibliography**
   - Need systematic Level 1-4 verification
   - Likely same pattern: point estimates without ranges
   - Should extract confidence intervals, not just headline numbers

3. **Implementation strategy**
   - How to add uncertainty sampling to Monte Carlo framework?
   - Which parameters need geographic disaggregation?
   - How to model temporal trends (values changing over time)?
   - How to implement adaptation mechanics?

AGREED ACTIONS:
---------------

1. **Update research standards in CLAUDE.md**
   - OLD: "2+ peer-reviewed sources" ‚Üí extract point estimates
   - NEW: "2+ peer-reviewed sources" ‚Üí extract ranges, caveats, confidence intervals

2. **Create GitHub issue: "Add uncertainty quantification to simulation parameters"**
   - Document which parameters need uncertainty ranges
   - Propose implementation strategy (sampling from distributions)
   - Include geographic heterogeneity requirements
   - Add temporal trend modeling

3. **Systematic review of remaining papers**
   - Cynthia: Level 1-2 verification (metadata, claim existence)
   - Sylvia: Level 3-4 verification (parameter accuracy, context)
   - Extract confidence intervals and authors' caveats

4. **Wiki updates**
   - Add uncertainty ranges to parameter documentation
   - Include authors' caveats and methodological assumptions
   - Document geographic variation where relevant
   - Note temporal trends (values change over time)

5. **Implementation recommendations**
   - Replace point estimates with distribution sampling
   - Add geographic disaggregation (regional variation)
   - Model temporal dynamics (values evolve)
   - Include adaptation mechanics (vulnerability decreases)
   - Net mortality accounting (heat + cold effects)

SUMMARY:
--------

The research foundation is solid - Richardson et al. (2023) and Vicedo-Cabrera et al. (2021) are high-quality, peer-reviewed papers with accurate core claims. The problem is OUR extraction methodology: we're stripping out the epistemic humility (uncertainty ranges, caveats, heterogeneity) that the authors carefully include.

This is a **quality improvement opportunity**, not a citation correction. By preserving the full richness of the source material - confidence intervals, geographic variation, temporal trends, methodological assumptions - we make the simulation MORE research-accurate.

Key insight: Optimism means finding REAL evidence with FULL uncertainty preserved. Sylvia's skeptical analysis makes the research BETTER, not less hopeful. Uncertainty is not pessimism - it's honesty.

Next steps: Complete Jackson et al. verification, systematic review of remaining 33 papers, implement uncertainty sampling in Monte Carlo framework.

This is collaborative research at its best! ü§ùüî¨‚úÖ
