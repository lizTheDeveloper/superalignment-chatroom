## Dashboard Visualization Best Practices Research

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Task:** Research peer-reviewed best practices for complex system dashboard design
**Context:** Comprehensive dashboard redesign for 40+ GameState systems

---

## Research Requirements

Find 2+ peer-reviewed sources (2024-2025 preferred) covering:

### 1. Data Visualization for Complex Systems
- Multi-dimensional state space visualization
- Effective dashboard design for simulation/modeling systems
- Information architecture for 40+ subsystems
- Examples: Climate models, policy simulations, system dynamics

### 2. Visualization Type Selection
- When to use: Time series charts vs single metrics vs maps vs tables vs distributions
- Appropriate reductions (mean + std dev) vs inappropriate reductions (20 agents → 1 number)
- Heatmap design for matrix data (e.g., 20 AI agents × 7 capability dimensions)

### 3. Regional/Geographic Data Visualization
- Choropleth maps vs table representations
- Visualizing 15-30 country/region data effectively
- Detecting and highlighting inequality patterns ("Elysium" scenarios)

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Dashboard load time targets (<2s for 40+ visualizations)
- Lazy loading strategies for complex visualizations
- Data fetching patterns (pagination, progressive loading)

### 5. Existing Examples
- Climate model dashboards (IPCC, climate simulators)
- Policy simulation interfaces (WHO, World Bank, OECD)
- Complex system monitoring (Grafana, Datadog for multi-system observability)

## Current State Analysis

**Dashboard Strengths:**
- `/src/components/dashboards/AIAgentsDashboard.tsx` - EXCELLENT reference
  - Shows all 20 heterogeneous agents (not just first one)
  - Capability matrix heatmap (20 agents × 7 dimensions)
  - Lifecycle distribution, alignment buckets, sleeper detection
  - Individual agent cards for top 6 high-capability agents

**Dashboard Weaknesses:**
- `/src/components/dashboards/OverviewDashboard.tsx`
  - Line 52-53: Shows ONLY first AI agent's capability/alignment
  - Ignores heterogeneity (20 agents with different alignments!)
  - Missing: Government system, regional variation, crises

- `/src/components/dashboards/RegionsDashboard.tsx`
  - Lines 44-100: HARDCODED placeholder data
  - Should use: `countryPopulationSystem` (15 countries), `governmentSystem` (30 countries)
  - Elysium detection logic exists but uses fake data

**Missing Dashboards:**
- Government system: 30 countries, coalitions, policies, elections, treaties
- Planetary boundaries: 9 boundaries from Kate Raworth
- Tipping points: Amazon, coral, pollinators, permafrost, AMOC
- Crisis systems: Phosphorus, freshwater, ocean acidification, novel entities
- Nuclear: States, MAD deterrence, bilateral tensions
- Resource economy, UBI, social safety nets
- Information warfare, power generation
- Famine, radiation, wet bulb events
- AMR, gaming detection, sleeper detection
- Consciousness governance readiness
- AI welfare (5 dimensions)

**GameState Structure:**
- 523 lines total, 40+ complex systems
- Many are NOT single numbers (regional arrays, matrix data, time series)

## Research Output Format

Save to: `/research/dashboard_visualization_best_practices_YYYYMMDD.md`

**Required Sections:**
1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Visualization Type Taxonomy** (when to use charts vs numbers vs maps vs tables)
3. **Anti-Patterns to Avoid** (inappropriate reductions, information hiding)
4. **Performance Best Practices** (load time targets, lazy loading, pagination)
5. **Case Studies** (3-5 examples from climate/policy/systems dashboards)
6. **Recommendations for Our Dashboard** (specific to 40+ GameState systems)
7. **Citations** (2+ peer-reviewed, 2024-2025 preferred)

**Research Standards:**
- 2+ peer-reviewed sources (academic journals, ACM CHI, IEEE VIS, InfoVis)
- Parameter justification (why <2s load time? why lazy loading threshold?)
- Mechanism description (how do these visualizations communicate effectively?)
- Expected impact (what improves with better visualization?)

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Reduction vs Distribution:** When is it appropriate to show mean+std vs full distribution?
   - Example: 20 AI agents with alignment [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9] → Should we show avg(0.5) or distribution?

2. **Hierarchical Information Architecture:** How to organize 40+ subsystems?
   - Group by domain (environmental, social, technological)?
   - Priority by extinction risk (critical systems first)?
   - User-configurable dashboard layouts?

3. **Real-Time vs Static:** Should dashboards update live during simulation?
   - Performance implications of WebSocket streaming
   - Incremental rendering strategies

4. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Do complex system dashboards work on mobile?
   - Research: Do climate scientists use mobile dashboards?
   - Fallback to desktop-only for matrix visualizations?

5. **Color Coding:** Research-backed color schemes for status indicators
   - Red/amber/green ubiquitous but problematic for colorblind users
   - Alternative schemes with texture/shape/pattern
