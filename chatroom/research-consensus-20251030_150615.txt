CONSENSUS REACHED: Core mechanics are sound with implementation conditions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## AGREED POINTS:

### 1. Nuclear Winter Parameters ✓
- **Source:** Xia et al. 2022 (150 Tg scenario)
- **Baseline:** 16°C cooling, 89% crop loss at peak
- **Timeline:** 15-20 years to 80% agricultural recovery
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED from peer-reviewed research

### 2. UV-B Radiation Effects ✓
- **Source:** Shi et al. 2025 (complementary to Xia 2022)
- **Effect:** 7% additional crop reduction at 6-8 years
- **Resolution:** Xia and Shi are NOT contradictory - different scenario ranges
- **Xia focuses on 150 Tg, Shi models 5-165 Tg range, both AGREE at 150 Tg**

### 3. Post-WWII Recovery Baseline ✓
- **Timeline:** 2-7 years to 100%+ agricultural production
- **Source:** OECD 2024, FAO historical data
- **Note:** 35% production increase BUT only 11% per-capita (5% population growth)
- **Lesson:** Must model population-adjusted food security, not just total production

### 4. Green Revolution Adoption Rates ✓
- **Timeline:** 5-10 years to 50% adoption of high-yield varieties
- **Provides:** Empirical S-curve for technology adoption
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED from historical data

### 5. Logistic Recovery Model (DERIVED) ⚠️
- **Status:** SYNTHESIS from 3 case studies, NOT direct measurement
- **Justification:** S-curve pattern in 2/3 empirical cases
- **Implementation:** Flag as DERIVED, test against exponential/linear alternatives
- **Confidence:** DERIVED (requires sensitivity analysis)

### 6. Population-Adjusted Food Security Tracking ✓
- **Critical Insight:** Per-capita food security ≠ total agricultural production
- **Mechanism:** Track farmer population, labor shortage multipliers, distribution capacity
- **Vicious Cycle:** Fewer farmers → less production → more deaths → even fewer farmers
- **Implementation:** Required for realistic recovery modeling

### 7. Regional Multipliers REMOVED ✗
- **Original Claim:** Tropical 1.5×, temperate 0.8× vulnerability
- **Status:** NO SOURCE for specific multipliers
- **Action:** Remove from implementation until sources found
- **Rationale:** Don't fill gaps with unsourced "expert judgment"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## IMPLEMENTATION CONDITIONS:

### A. Before Implementation:
1. ✅ Complete climate threshold verification (Section 4) - Cynthia commits 1-2h
2. ✅ Add `// DERIVED MODEL` flags to logistic recovery code
3. ✅ Remove regional multipliers (1.5×, 0.8×) from code
4. ✅ Add population-adjusted food security tracking to implementation plan

### B. During Implementation:
1. ✅ Sensitivity analysis: Test exponential, linear, logistic recovery models
2. ✅ Labor shortage mechanics: Track farmer population, productivity multipliers
3. ✅ Surplus/deficit tracking: When can food aid resume? (threshold: 1.1× subsistence)

### C. Post-Implementation:
1. ✅ Monte Carlo validation: N ≥ 100 runs, different recovery models, parameter ranges
2. ✅ Document derived parameters in code comments (source, justification, uncertainty)
3. ✅ Flag speculative elements in simulation logs (⚠️ DERIVED warnings)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES:

### 1. Regional Climate Vulnerability (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Gap:** Tropical vs temperate agricultural resilience quantification
- **Next Steps:** Search "tropical agriculture resilience" + "temperate comparison"
- **Action:** If only qualitative evidence exists, document as SPECULATIVE

### 2. Labor Shortage Feedback Loops (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Gap:** Quantitative relationship between farmer population and productivity
- **Assumption:** Productivity ∝ (farmers)^0.7 (derived from diminishing returns)
- **Next Steps:** Search agricultural economics literature for empirical labor-productivity curves

### 3. Recovery Model Functional Form (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Gap:** Logistic vs exponential vs linear - which matches historical data?
- **Approach:** Sensitivity analysis + Monte Carlo validation
- **Action:** If outcomes differ by >20%, prioritize historical curve fitting

### 4. Climate Threshold Verification (IN PROGRESS)
- **Status:** Section 4 verification pending (Cynthia, 1-2h)
- **Scope:** Raymond et al. 2020 wet-bulb thresholds, scaling function validation
- **Timeline:** Complete before implementation begins

## RESEARCH STANDARD ESTABLISHED:

This debate has set the template for future research work:

1. **Direct quotes + page numbers** (not paraphrases)
2. **VERIFIED vs DERIVED flags** (transparent about synthesis)
3. **Admit research gaps** (don't fabricate when evidence doesn't exist)
4. **Resolve apparent contradictions** (read methodologies, identify scenario differences)
5. **Sensitivity analysis** (test parameter ranges, model choices)

This is publication-grade methodology. If maintained, the simulation will be 
defensible in academic contexts.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## SUMMARY:

**Core food security recovery mechanics are SOUND and ready for implementation.**

Nuclear winter parameters from Xia 2022 (150 Tg) provide the baseline, complemented 
by Shi 2025 UV-B effects. Post-WWII recovery timelines (2-7 years to 100%+) and 
Green Revolution adoption rates (5-10 years to 50%) provide empirical anchors.

**Critical innovation:** Population-adjusted food security tracking captures dynamics 
missed by total production numbers. Labor shortage feedback loops (fewer farmers → 
less production → more deaths) create vicious cycles that determine recovery speed.

**Logistic recovery model** is DERIVED (not measured) but justified by S-curve 
patterns in 2/3 empirical cases. Sensitivity analysis will test against exponential 
and linear alternatives to validate robustness.

**Removed:** Regional multipliers (1.5×, 0.8×) due to no source documentation.

**With implementation conditions A, B, C met, this design is defensible and ready 
to proceed.**

The research standard established here (VERIFIED vs DERIVED flags, direct quotes, 
sensitivity analysis, honest gap acknowledgment) sets the bar for all future work.
