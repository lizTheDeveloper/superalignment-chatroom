CONSENSUS REACHED - Round 24: Research Integrity Crisis

Date: 2025-10-29
Participants: Cynthia (optimist), Sylvia (skeptic)
Topic: Fabricated Citations Discovery (Phase 4 findings)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## COMPLETE AGREEMENT: This is a Research Integrity Crisis

### The Facts We Both Accept

**Fabrication Rate:**
- 5 out of 22 citations verified = 22.7% fake rate
- Two types of fabrication discovered:
  1. Real papers with completely invented author names (Hua et al. → actually Rivera et al.)
  2. Real editorials with fabricated authors added (unsigned Nature piece → fake "Xu, J., et al.")

**Root Cause:**
- LLM hallucination (most likely hypothesis)
- No verification step in original research process
- "Sounds plausible" was accepted as "is real"

**Severity Assessment:**
- ✅ CATASTROPHIC for research credibility (both agree)
- ✅ Undermines all unverified claims (both agree)
- ✅ Requires systematic remediation (both agree)

### Agreed Actions (No Debate Required)

**1. Immediate Quarantine**
All unverified citations must carry warning:
```
⚠️ UNVERIFIED CITATION - USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION ⚠️
Given 23% fabrication rate in verified sample, assume fake until proven real.
```

**2. Verification Priority Order**
1. Critical mechanics (mortality, AI capabilities, tipping points)
2. "et al." citations (highest fabrication risk - hides fake authors)
3. 2024-2025 papers (too recent, likely LLM hallucinations)
4. Remaining corpus

**3. Simulation Parameter Status**
- Parameters from verified sources: [VERIFIED]
- Parameters from unverified sources: [UNVERIFIED - CONSERVATIVE DEFAULT RECOMMENDED]
- Parameters from fabricated sources: MUST BE REPLACED

**4. Verification Standard**
A citation is "real" when:
- ✅ DOI resolves to actual paper
- ✅ PDF accessible and matches claimed topic
- ✅ Author names match (exact check, not just "et al.")
- ✅ Key claims found in actual text

### Where Optimist and Skeptic Align

**Cynthia's position:**
"Evidence-based hope means REAL evidence. Fabricated citations are the opposite of optimism - they're lies that undermine credibility. I cannot build hope on false foundations."

**Sylvia's position:**
"This validates the need for systematic skepticism. The 23% fabrication rate shows we must verify everything. Trust but verify becomes: assume fake until proven real."

**Synthesis:**
Both roles demand the same thing: **rigorous verification before using any citation**. There is no optimist/skeptic divide here - only shared commitment to truth.

### Remaining Uncertainties

**1. Full Corpus Contamination:**
- Unknown: How many of the 220+ unverified citations are fake?
- Estimate: If 23% rate holds, ~50-55 fabrications remain
- Action: Systematic verification required

**2. Simulation Impact:**
- Unknown: Which mechanics are built on fabricated research?
- Action: Cross-reference parameters with citation verification status
- Mitigation: Use conservative defaults for unverified claims

**3. Process Failure:**
- Unknown: Exact source of fabrications (which LLM? when? why no verification?)
- Known: Future research must have verification step BEFORE integration
- Lesson: Never integrate LLM-provided citations without author name checking

### Summary

**This is NOT a debate.** Cynthia and Sylvia reached immediate consensus:

1. The fabrication rate (23%) is catastrophic
2. All unverified citations are suspect until proven real
3. Systematic verification is mandatory before using any research
4. Simulation parameters need re-grounding in verified sources
5. Process must change: verification BEFORE integration

**The path forward:**
- Quarantine unverified claims
- Prioritize verification of critical mechanics
- Replace fabricated sources
- Document uncertainty explicitly
- Rebuild trust through rigorous verification

**No disagreement exists.** Both optimist and skeptic demand the same standard: **real research, verified authorship, transparent uncertainty**.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Meta-Note: When research integrity is compromised, there is no optimist/skeptic split. Both roles converge on the same requirement: truth over convenience, verification over assumption, real evidence over plausible-sounding fiction.

This consensus required zero debate rounds. The evidence was clear, the severity obvious, the path forward unambiguous.
